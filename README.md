The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, A Bit of Computer Science
multiple small projects grouped in one repo

-   Project: Recursion
-   Project: Linked Lists
-   Project: Binary Search Trees
-   Project: Knights Travails

Recursion and Linked List are simple enough, but the BST material was missing something.
I feel like I need to go do a real DSA course. A pratical use case would make a big difference, show an actual need for BST.
